    You are working on a sorting and filtering application for a list of products. Implement a ProductManager class that uses an iterator and a comparator to manage products. Include the following methods:

public void addProduct(Product product): This method should add a new product to the list.
public List<Product> getSortedProducts(Comparator<Product> comparator): This method should return a list of products sorted according to the provided comparator.
public List<Product> filterProducts(Predicate<Product> predicate): This method should return a list of products that match the provided predicate.
Create an instance of the ProductManager class, add products, sort products by price, and filter products by category.
