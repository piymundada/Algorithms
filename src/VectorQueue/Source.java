/*
Problem Statement:
You are given 4 books. You are required to place them in a stack, and then pick the book at the top and read 100 pages of it. The book object contains a title and the number of pages which you have to read.  In a single reading session, you can only read 100 pages. After a book is completed, remove it from the stack, and then begin reading the book that is now at the top of the stack.

Write a program that would first push the books into the stack, and then read all the books one by one, 100 pages at a time.

You will define a stack of Book objects as:
Stack<Book> bookStack = new Stack<Book>();

Output:
Reading 100 pages of Tinkle
Reading 100 pages of Lord of the Rings
Reading 100 pages of Lord of the Rings
Reading 100 pages of Lord of the Rings
Reading 100 pages of Champak
Reading 100 pages of Harry Potter
Reading 100 pages of Harry Potter
